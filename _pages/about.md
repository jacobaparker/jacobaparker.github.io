Hello! My name is Jake and I'm a computational and theoretical neuroscientist. I am currently completing my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Josh Gold](https://www.med.upenn.edu/goldlab/) and [Joe Kable](https://www.kablelab.com/) with funding from a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

My work seeks to reveal the principles governing inference in the brain, with an emphasis on explaining the high degree of individual variability we observe both behaviorally and neurally.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

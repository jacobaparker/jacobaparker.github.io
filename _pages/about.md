Welcome to my website! My name is Jake and I'm currently completing my PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania. My thesis work is advised by [Josh Gold](https://www.med.upenn.edu/goldlab/) and [Joe Kable](https://www.kablelab.com/), and is supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I study the **principles governing inference in the brain**, with an emphasis on explaining the **high degree of individual variability** we observe both behaviorally and neurally. In my current work, I find that a lot of this variability reflects **flexible tradeoffs** between **maximizing performance** and **minimizing the use of costly cognitive resources**. Two ways people appear to minimize the cost of inference are (roughly speaking) **1)** reducing the computational precision of inference, and **2)** using simpler (heuristic) inference strategies. I use theory, computational modeling, and experiments to explore these and other ideas, which you can read more about [here](/research/).

<!-- I study the principles governing inference in the brain, with an emphasis on explaining the high degree of individual variability we observe both behaviorally and neurally. In my current work, I find that a lot of this individual variability reflects people flexibly trading off accuracy with various forms of cognitive/neural cost reduction. Two prominent ways that people appear to reduce the cost of inference are roughly equivalent to 1) reducing the neural precision of one's inferences, and 2) using simpler (heuristic) inference strategies. I have used mathematical analysis, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments to explore these and other ideas, which you can read more about under the [research](/research/) tab. -->

In addition to my research work, I engage in various forms of science communication and outreach. From 2022-2024, I was co-chair of the [Penn Neuroscience Public Lecture Series](https://www.upennglia.com/community-outreach). As a writer for [PennNeuroKnow](https://pennneuroknow.com/), I have written [four original articles](https://pennneuroknow.com/archives/#jp) about topics in neuroscience for a non-scientific audience. In 2022, I co-authored a [science policy memo](https://medium.com/scitech-forefront/neutralizing-the-algorithm-approaches-for-reducing-the-spread-of-disinformation-online-7087f3e2c581) and met with state and federal legislators to discuss its content. I have been a [mentor for Project Short](https://www.project-short.com/pre-grad-mentors/jake-parker), a non-profit that provides pro-bono application support (essay reviews, mock interviews, etc) to those facing barriers to applying for grad school. Through these and other activities, I aim to increase public scientific literacy and make academia more accessible.

I obtained my B.Sc. in neuroscience from New York University in 2017. As an undergraduate research assistant in the [Carrasco Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/carrascolab/), I developed an approach to modeling pupil responses evoked by cognitive events. After graduating, I spent four years studying the pathophysiology of movement disorders as an NIH postbac in the lab of [Mark Hallett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hallett_(neurologist)).

Outside of my work, I enjoy Olympic-style weightlifting, photography, spending time with friends, and learning new things.

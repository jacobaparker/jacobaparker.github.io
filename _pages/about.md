Hello! My name is Jake and I'm a computational and theoretical neuroscientist. I am currently completing my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of [Josh Gold](https://www.med.upenn.edu/goldlab/) and [Joe Kable](https://www.kablelab.com/) with support from an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I study the principles governing inference in the brain, with an emphasis on explaining the high degree of individual variability we observe both behaviorally and neurally. In my current work, I find that a lot of this individual variability reflects people flexibly trading off accuracy with various forms of cognitive/neural cost reduction. Two prominent ways that people appear to reduce the cost of inference are roughly equivalent to 1) reducing the neural precision of one's inferences, and 2) using simpler (heuristic) inference strategies. I have used mathematical analysis, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments to explore these and other ideas, which you can read more about under the [research](/research/) tab.

I obtained my B.Sc. in neuroscience from New York University in 2017. As an undergrad, I worked on developing an approach to modeling pupil responses evoked by cognitive events in the [Carrasco Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/carrascolab/). After graduating, I spent four years studying the pathophysiology of movement disorders as an NIH postbac in the lab of [Mark Hallett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hallett_(neurologist)). While I initially intended to pursue my interest in the brain in the context of medicine, it was through these two research experiences that I discovered a passion for research. I realized that I was particularly drawn to the princpled descriptions of brain and behavior that theoretical/computational neuroscience could provide.

Growing up in the DC area and up until the end of college, I spent much of my free time in the pool as a competitive swimmer. Nowadays, I enjoy Olympic-style weightlifting, photography, spending time with friends, and learning new things.
